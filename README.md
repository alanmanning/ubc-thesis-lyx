# A LyX template for UBC theses

## About this template

### What is this?
This is a template for Doctoral and Masters theses at the University of British Columbia. This template is for use with [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/), which is built upon LaTeX. I wrote my Masters thesis in LaTeX and found it to be a painful endeavour. I wrote my PhD thesis in LyX and it was significantly smoother.

### Who should use this?
Anyone who knows a bit of LaTeX but wants to try something a little easier (at least, I found it easier).

### Do I need to know anything about LaTeX and LyX to use this?
You should probably know a bit of LaTeX. There will be times when you need to insert LaTeX code (or ERT - Evil Red Text as LyX calls it) into your document. Also, because LyX renders with LaTeX, there will be some inevitable debugging.

### Is this guaranteed to produce a properly formatted thesis?
No, it's not, but it did work for me and I've tried to ensure it will work for you. You should definitely review the UBC thesis [formatting requirements](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation/formatting-requirements). Also, submit your thesis for [pre-review](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation/pre-reviews) well ahead of any deadlines to catch any formatting issues.
