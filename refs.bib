  Abstract                 = {The structure of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) made by mild acid hydrolysis from cotton linter, flax fibres and sulphite or kraft cooked wood pulp was studied and compared with the structure of the starting materials. Crystallinities and the length and the width of the cellulose crystallites were determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering and the packing and the cross-sectional shape of the microfibrils were determined by small-angle X-ray scattering. The morphological differences were studied by scanning electron microscopy. A model for the changes in microfibrillar structure between native materials, pulp and MCC samples was proposed. The results indicated that from softwood or hardwood pulp, flax cellulose and cotton linter MCC with very similar nanostructures were obtained with small changes in reaction conditions. The crystallinity of MCC samples was 54--65{\%}. The width and the length of the cellulose crystallites increased when MCC was made. For example, between cotton and cotton MCC the width increased from 7.1??nm to 8.8??nm and the length increased from 17.7??nm to 30.4??nm. However, the longest crystallites were found in native spruce wood (35--36??nm).},

Measurements of the spin-spin relaxation decay curve in white matter reveal a short T2 component arising from water compartmentalized in the myelin sheaths of neuronal axons. This signal can be separated from the rest of the signal in white matter to produce myelin water images. This article begins with a description of the structure and function of myelin and provides a motivation for imaging myelin in vivo. We then summarize the current state of myelin water imaging using magnetic resonance (MR). Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of myelin water imaging. Finally, we highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, and repair.},

  abstract  = {The hypothetical questions which were asked earlier may now be answered as follows. Myelin lipids do possess characteristics which could lead to a tightly organized, closely packed, highly stable membrane structure, while lipids in adjacent neurons and glial cells do possess characteristics which could give rise to a more loosely organized, less stable membrane structure. The greater degree of metabolic inertness of myelin lipids may be explained on this basis. The stability of myelin itself may also be based largely on the intermolecular cohesion between lipid molecules, since the lipid content of myelin is extraordinarily high. Physiological and clinical studies tend to support the concept that a surfeit of polyunsaturated lipids or a deficiency of long-chain sphingolipids can result in a more easily disrupted membrane. The most important prediction to be drawn from these speculations is that myelin may be rendered unstable in disease if its lipid composition is altered so that higher proportions of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower proportions of lipids containing very-long-chain fatty acids are present.},

The major lipids, including ethanolamine glycerophosphatides (EGP), serine glycerophosphatides (SGP), choline glycerophosphatides (CGP), sphingomyelin, cerebroside, cerebroside sulfate, and ceramide were isolated by column chromatography and their fatty acid and fatty aldehyde compositions were determined by gas–liquid chromatography.EGP and SGP from myelin had a fatty aldehyde composition which differed from that of EGP and SGP from gray matter; octadecenaldehydes were present in much higher proportions in these lipids from myelin than in those from gray matter. EGP and SGP also contained high proportions of 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, whereas CGP contained small proportions of these acids. Each glycerophosphatide from gray matter contained approximately 3- to 6-fold higher proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids than did the same glycerophosphatide from myelin. Sphingomyelin, cerebroside, cerebroside sulfate, and ceramide also differed in their fatty acid compositions depending upon their tissue source; each sphingolipid from myelin in the younger subjects contained 5- to 9-fold higher proportions of long-chain fatty acids (C19-C26) than did the same sphingolipid from gray matter.The lipids from myelin in the baby (10 months) were very similar to those from myelin in the adult, both with respect to their content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and to their content of long-chain fatty acids. These findings suggest that myelin in the baby is “chemically mature” in its lipid composition at an early age.},

  abstract = {Gray matter, white matter, and myelin were isolated from the frontal lobes of humans aged 10 months, 6 yr, 9 yr, and 55 yr and the lipid compositions of each were determined. Myelin had a much higher lipid content (78–81% of the dry weight) than white matter (49–66%) or gray matter (36–40%). Myelin contained much higher molar percentages of cerebroside and cerebroside sulfate, slightly higher molar percentages of cholesterol, and lower molar percentages of ethanolamine glycerophosphatides and choline glycerophosphatides than gray matter. The molar percentages of serine glycerophosphatides and sphingomyelin were about the same in each tissue.The aldehyde content of glycerophosphatides, expressed as molar percentage of the total lipoidal residues in each lipid, were as follows: ethanolamine glycerophosphatides from myelin 40–50%; ethanolamine glycerophosphatides from gray matter 21–27%; serine glycerophosphatides from myelin 21–36%; serine glycerophosphatides from gray matter 0.3–3.8%. Choline glycerophosphatides from either tissue contained only traces of aldehydes.The extra-myelin portion of white matter had a lipid composition that was very similar to that of myelin, but quite different from that of gray matter.Assuming a molecular weight of 28,000 for myelin protein(s), it was calculated that for each protein molecule in human myelin there are 186 lipid molecules, 111 of which are polar lipids and 75 of which consist of cholesterol. The over-all molar ratios of the polar lipids are phosphatidal ethanolamine:serine glycerophosphatides:choline glycerophosphatides:sphingomyelin:cerebroside:cerebroside sulfate:ceramide:uncharacterized lipids 25:9:20:9:29:7:3:9. It was calculated that the molar ratio of protein amino acids to polar lipids in human myelin is 2.38 to 1.},

  abstract  = {The integrated T1–T2 characteristics of rat brain and trigeminal nerve water were studied in vivo using a rapid method for acquiring a series of images that depend on T1 and T2 relaxation times. Gray matter regions showed only one signal component in both the T1 and T2 domains. Trigeminal nerve, however, which has been shown previously to exhibit three T2 components, was found to also exhibit three T1 components. The correlations between these T1 and T2 components were demonstrated by uniquely filtering out each of the three T2 components using an inversion-recovery preparation, as determined by the component T1 values. Based on previous works, it is postulated that each of these three signal components is derived from a unique microanatomical region of the nerve. Knowledge of these T1 components may thus prove valuable in devising novel methods of identifying the presence and quantifying the volume of tissue subtypes such as myelin.

The ihMT contrast is obtained by subtracting magnetization transfer images obtained with simultaneous saturation at positive and negative frequency offsets (dual frequency saturation experiment, MT +/−) from those obtained with single frequency saturation (MT +) at the same total power. Hence, ihMT may be biased by MT-asymmetry, especially at ultra-high magnetic field. Use of the average of single positive and negative frequency offset saturation MT images, i.e., (MT ++MT −) has been proposed to correct the ihMT signal from MT-asymmetry signal.},

  abstract = { Fixation of rat hypothalamus in 4\% formaldehyde + 1\% CaCl2 for 24 hr at 0°C reduced the amount of extractable ethanolamine phospholipids considerably. This decrease may be caused by hydrolytic cleavage of the vinyl ether bond in phosphatidalethanolamine and by reaction of formaldehyde with the free amino groups in ethanolamine phospholipids. Evidence is presented that the reaction with free amino groups may be the main cause for the decrease of extractable phospholipids when dealing with a fixative that contains glutaraldehyde and is buffered at pH 7. In this case no phosphatidylserine and hardly any phosphatidylethanolamine could be detected in the tissue extract. It is presumed that these phospholipids are fixed to proteins by the cross-linking action of glutaraldehyde involving free amino groups of proteins and phospholipids. },

White matter of the frontal lobe and of oerebellum was submitted for histological and biochemical analysis. The neuropathological data provided a rationale for dividing the material into two subgroups: one including patients mainly with vascular changes in the brain, and the other consisting of patients with senile atrophy of the Alzheimer type. Chemical alterations noted both in frontal lobe and in cerebellum were an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine content and a marked decrease in myelin yield. Additionally, The chemical results were almost identical in the two subgroups of patients, although they differ in neuropathological patterns of lesions. It is emphasized that the general decrease in myelin yield as well as some minor changes in myelin lipid pattern seem to be a sign of aging and are not connected with atrophy of the Alzheimer type.},

  abstract = {Purpose The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of water compartmentation and heterogeneous relaxation properties on quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging in tissues, and in particular whether a two-pool model is sufficient to describe qMT data in brain tumors. Methods Computer simulations and in vivo experiments with a series of qMT measurements before and after injection of Gd-DTPA were performed. Both off-resonance pulsed saturation (pulsed) and on-resonance selective inversion recovery (SIR) qMT methods were used, and all data were fit with a two-pool model only. Results Simulations indicated that a two-pool fitting of four-pool data yielded accurate measures of pool size ratio (PSR) of macromolecular versus free water protons when there were fast transcytolemmal exchange and slow R1 recovery. The fitted in vivo PSR of both pulsed and SIR qMT methods showed no dependence on R1 variations caused by different concentrations of Gd-DTPA during wash-out, whereas the fitted kex (magnetization transfer exchange rate) changed significantly with R1. Conclusion A two-pool model provides reproducible estimates of PSR in brain tumors independent of relaxation properties in the presence of relatively fast transcytolemmal exchange, whereas estimates of kex are biased by relaxation variations. In addition, estimates of PSR in brain tumors using the pulsed and SIR qMT methods agree well with one another. Magn Reson Med 76:635–644, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the proton second and fourth moments have been undertaken for multilamellar dispersions, in excess water, of protiated and chain-perdeuterated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) in the temperature range -20 to 50 degrees C. The comparison of the measured moment with the rigid lattice M2 and the calculated second moment values in the presence of certain motions gives insight into the dynamic structure of the methylene chains of DPPC. This study demonstrates that at -15 degrees C there is still a significant amount of methylene chain motion or disorder in DPPC. At 35 degrees C the moment values indicate that the methylene chains are not in the fully extended all-trans conformation and they may also be rotationally disordered. At the pretransition there is a decrease in magnitude of the proton second moments, which can be accounted for by an increase in the lateral diffusion rate to a value greater than 10(-11) cm2/s. This work suggests that at temperatures just below the main transition the chain conformation is considerably different from the common model structure (P beta') in which the chains are fully extended. In the liquid-crystalline phase the proton moment data are in agreement with data from other techniques on the liquid-like nature of the methylene chains. It is demonstrated how the values of the moment ratio M4r/(M2r)2, which are relatively constant within each phase, can be used to calculate the molar fractions of coexisting liquid-crystalline and gel-phase phospholipid at temperatures near the main transition.},

Regions were identified on high-resolution anatomical scans using a combination of manual and automatic methods. Only voxels identified as pure tissue at the resolution of the quantitative scans were considered for analysis. While no left/right differences were observed, significant differences were found among white-matter regions and gray-matter regions. These regional differences were compared with existing cytoarchitectural data. In addition, the pattern and magnitude of the regional differences observed in white matter was found to be different from that reported previously for an alternative putative MRI measure of myelination, the 10–50-ms T2 component described as myelin water.

  abstract      = {Summary:
About 20 years ago, a technological innovation process started that eventually led to the affirmation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, which are used today in about 25% of all MRI procedures, as medical diagnostic tools. The process began with exploration of various technical possibilities and the conception in the years 1981 to 1982 of two types of agents (soluble paramagnetic chelates and protection colloid-stabilized colloidal particle solutions of magnetite) that eventually found embodiments in commercially available products. The pioneering products that eventually reached the market were gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist ® , Schering AG) and the ferumoxides (Endorem ® , Guerbet SA; or Ferridex ® , Berlex Laboratories Inc.). The history of the conception phase of the technology is reconstructed here, focusing on the social dynamics rather than on technological aspects. In the period 1981 to 1982, a number of independent inventors from industry and academia conceived of water-soluble paramagnetic chelates and protection colloid-stabilized colloidal solutions of small particles of magnetite, both of acceptable tolerability, as contrast agents for MRI. Priorities on patents conditioned the further course of events. The analyzed history helps in understanding the typical roles of different institutions in technological innovation. The foundation of MRI contrast agent technology in basic science clearly was laid in academia. During the conception of practical products, industry assumed a dominant role. Beginning with the radiological evaluation of candidate products, the collaboration between industry and academia became essential.},
